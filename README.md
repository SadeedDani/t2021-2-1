Calculator class:

This class features the cl method, which performs calculations based on provided numbers and operators.
Utilizing a switch statement, the method selects the appropriate operation and computes the result.
It includes handling for division by zero, ensuring error-free execution.
Program1 class:

Serving as the program's entry point, this class contains the main method.
An instance of the Calculator class is created, and user input for two numbers and an operator is acquired.
Subsequently, the calc method of the Calculator class is invoked to perform the calculation and display the result.
Odd Numbers Program
The project encompasses a single class:

Program2 class:
Serving as the program's entry point, this class contains the main method.
User input for a number is obtained using the Scanner class.
The program iterates from 1 to (n*2)-1, where n represents the input number.
During each iteration, it checks if the current number is odd (i%2!=0). If affirmative, the number is printed.
Odd Numbers Program
The project comprises a single class:

Program3 class:
As the program's entry point, this class contains the main method.
User input for a number is collected using the Scanner class.
A value, val, is then calculated based on the input number. If the number is odd, val is set to the input number; otherwise, it is set to the input number minus one.
The program proceeds to iterate from 0 to (val*2)-1.
During each iteration, it checks if the current number is odd (i%2!=0). If affirmative, the number is printed.
Multiples Count Program
The project includes a single class:

Program4 class:
As the program's entry point, this class contains the main method.
User input for the size of the array is obtained using the Scanner class.
Subsequently, input for the elements of the array is acquired using a loop, and they are stored in the array ar.
An array multiple is defined, containing the numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], which are checked for multiples.
The program utilizes a HashMap called countMap to store the count of multiples.
The count map is initialized with multiples and a default count of 0.
It iterates through the array and counts the multiples for each number using nested loops, updating the count in the countMap.
Finally, it prints the count map with the multiples and their corresponding counts.
